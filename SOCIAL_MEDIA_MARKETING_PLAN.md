# Social Media Marketing Plan — CatchUp

**Working App Names:** CatchUp · CaughtUp · Ketchup (pending handle/domain availability)
**Date:** February 8, 2026
**Founder Tone:** Casual, relatable, "building in public"

---

## How This Doc Works

Everything is split into **two voices**:

- **🧑 Personal accounts** (you, the founder) — LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram
- **📱 App accounts** — Twitter/X primarily, LinkedIn secondary, Instagram eventually

And **three phases**:

1. **Pre-launch** (now → launch day) — build audience, validate, tease
2. **Launch week** — coordinated push
3. **Post-launch** (ongoing) — grow, engage, convert

Each section has ready-to-use example posts you can adapt.

---

## Channel Overview

| Channel | Personal Account | App Account | Priority |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Twitter/X** | Build in public, engage productivity community | Product updates, summaries, tips | 🔴 High |
| **LinkedIn** | Founder story, professional insights, career angle | Company page — summaries, thought leadership | 🔴 High |
| **Instagram** | Behind-the-scenes, lifestyle, reels | Visual content, carousels, reels | 🟡 Medium (post-launch) |
| **Reddit** | Engage in communities (not sell) | Don't create one yet | 🟡 Medium (post-launch) |
| **Indie Hackers** | Build-in-public journal | N/A | 🔴 High (pre-launch) |

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch (Start Now)

**Goal:** Build an audience before you have a product. Get people invested in the journey so they're ready to try it on day one.

**Key principles:**
- You're not selling anything yet — you're sharing a journey
- Ask questions, don't make announcements
- Every post should either teach something, ask something, or show something real
- Aim for 3-5 posts per week across channels

---

### 🧑 Personal Accounts — Pre-Launch

#### Twitter/X (Personal)

**What to post:**

**1. The "aha moment" origin story (pin this)**

> I have 400+ YouTube videos in my Watch Later.
>
> I'm never going to watch them.
>
> But I still feel guilty every time I open the app.
>
> So I'm building something about it. More soon.

**2. Polls and audience research**

> Quick question for the YouTube addicts:
>
> How many videos are in your Watch Later right now?
>
> ☐ Under 50 (you're lying)
> ☐ 50-200
> ☐ 200-500
> ☐ 500+ (welcome to the club)

---

> What type of YouTube content do you wish you had more time for?
>
> ☐ Tech / programming tutorials
> ☐ Business / entrepreneurship
> ☐ Health / fitness / science
> ☐ Other (reply below)

---

> Which YouTube channels do you watch most?
>
> Not "which do you subscribe to" — which do you actually *watch*?
>
> Drop names below 👇 I'm genuinely curious.

---

> If an AI could summarize a YouTube video for you — what would you want?
>
> ☐ Quick bullet points (30 seconds)
> ☐ Detailed summary with key ideas (5-10 min read)
> ☐ Audio version I can listen to
> ☐ Flashcards / quiz to test my memory

---

> Be honest: how many podcast episodes / YouTube videos have you saved "for later" this week?
>
> And how many did you actually consume?

**3. Building in public updates**

> Day 1 of building a YouTube summarizer app.
>
> Everyone told me the market is saturated. I tested 12 competitors this week.
>
> Here's what none of them get right: [thread 🧵]

---

> Spent the weekend testing every YouTube summarizer I could find.
>
> The accuracy is... bad. Like "made up a statistic that wasn't in the video" bad.
>
> Turns out there's a real gap between "summarize this" and "summarize this *correctly*."

---

> Building in public update:
>
> Just got my first contextual summary working.
>
> A 45-minute Huberman episode → 12-minute read that actually preserves the reasoning, not just bullet points.
>
> The difference between "what he said" and "why it matters" is everything.

**4. Pain point content (relatable)**

> The YouTube Watch Later playlist is the modern-day stack of unread books on your nightstand.
>
> Except the stack is infinite and it follows you to work.

---

> There's a special kind of guilt that comes from subscribing to 40 educational YouTube channels and watching none of them.
>
> We need a word for this. Suggestions?

---

> My friend just told me he spent 3 hours watching YouTube "research" videos for work.
>
> The actual useful info? Maybe 20 minutes.
>
> That ratio is broken.

**5. Competitor/market insights**

> I signed up for 8 YouTube summarizer tools this week.
>
> 6 of them gave me a free tier of 3 videos per day.
>
> Three. Per day.
>
> That's not a free tier. That's a demo.

---

> Interesting thing I learned while researching: 40-50% of people who save YouTube videos just... never watch them. And accept the FOMO.
>
> They don't even look for tools. They just live with the guilt.
>
> That's the real competitor — doing nothing.

---

#### LinkedIn (Personal)

LinkedIn posts should be longer, more reflective, and tie into professional growth. Still casual, but with more depth.

**1. The founder story**

> I have a confession.
>
> My YouTube Watch Later playlist has 400+ videos. Mostly stuff like:
> - That Huberman episode on sleep everyone recommended
> - The Y Combinator talk my coworker shared
> - A 3-part series on system design I bookmarked 8 months ago
>
> I'm never going to watch them all. And every time I open YouTube, I feel a small pang of guilt.
>
> I started calling it "backlog guilt" — that low-grade frustration of knowing there's great content out there that could help you professionally, but you just don't have 45 minutes to sit through a video right now.
>
> So I started building something about it.
>
> More details coming soon. But first — a question:
>
> Am I the only one with this problem? How big is your unwatched backlog?

**2. Professional insight posts**

> Hot take: We're in the golden age of free education on YouTube.
>
> The problem isn't access. It's consumption.
>
> A single Lex Fridman episode is 3 hours. A CS lecture series is 40 videos. That business strategy breakdown you bookmarked? 52 minutes.
>
> The content is incredible. The format doesn't fit our lives.
>
> I think the next wave of learning tools won't create more content — they'll help us actually absorb what already exists.
>
> What's your approach to keeping up with long-form video content?

**3. Building in public (LinkedIn style)**

> Week 3 of building a YouTube summarizer app — here's what I've learned so far:
>
> I tested 12 existing tools. The market looks crowded until you actually use them.
>
> The biggest surprise? Accuracy. Most tools use a single AI model to summarize, and the hallucination rate is genuinely alarming. One tool told me a speaker recommended a book they never mentioned.
>
> That's not a summary. That's misinformation.
>
> So our approach: use multiple AI models to cross-check each other. Slower? Yes. More expensive? Yes. But when you're summarizing a medical video or a financial explainer, "close enough" isn't good enough.
>
> Anyone else think accuracy is the most underrated feature in AI tools right now?

**4. Engagement / polls**

> Quick poll for the lifelong learners on here:
>
> When you find a great educational YouTube video but don't have time to watch it, what do you do?
>
> A) Save it and feel guilty forever
> B) Watch at 2x speed (and retain maybe 40%)
> C) Ask someone to summarize it
> D) Skip it and accept FOMO
>
> I'm building something for the people who answered A. More soon.

---

#### Instagram (Personal)

Pre-launch Instagram is about *you*, not the app. Behind-the-scenes, relatable lifestyle content.

**Stories (casual, daily-ish):**
- Screenshot of your Watch Later playlist with the count circled. Caption: "we need to talk about this number"
- Screen recording of testing a competitor tool getting a summary hilariously wrong
- Coffee + laptop setup shot. Caption: "day 14 of building something to fix my YouTube addiction"
- Poll sticker: "How many YouTube videos are in your Watch Later?" with number options
- "This or that" sticker: "Watch the full 45min video OR read a 10min summary?"

**Reels / posts:**
- You scrolling through an impossibly long Watch Later list, speeding up progressively, with text overlay: "me telling myself I'll watch these eventually"
- Side-by-side: "What I planned to learn from YouTube this month" vs "What I actually watched" (relatable humor)

---

### 📱 App Accounts — Pre-Launch

**Don't create app accounts until ~2-3 weeks before launch.** Pre-launch is all about your personal brand. When you do create them:

**Twitter/X (App — teaser mode):**

> Something's coming for your Watch Later playlist.
>
> 👀

---

> Every YouTube summary tool we tested got something wrong.
>
> We're building the one that doesn't.
>
> Waitlist: [link]

**LinkedIn (App — company page):**

Keep minimal. A few posts establishing the brand, linking to the waitlist. Most of the heavy lifting stays on your personal account during pre-launch.

---

## Phase 2: Launch Week

**Goal:** Coordinated push across all channels. Get downloads, get feedback, create a moment.

---

### 🧑 Personal Accounts — Launch Week

#### Twitter/X (Personal)

**The launch thread (pin this):**

> It's live. 🚀
>
> After [X] weeks of building, testing, and way too many Watch Later guilt spirals — CatchUp is on the App Store.
>
> It turns YouTube videos into summaries you can actually trust.
>
> Here's what makes it different (and what I learned building it): 🧵
>
> 1/ The problem: 400+ videos in my Watch Later. Sound familiar?
>
> I tested 12 summarizer tools. Most were fast but wrong. One invented a book recommendation. Another missed the entire second half of a video.
>
> "Fast but inaccurate" doesn't help anyone.
>
> 2/ So CatchUp does something different: multiple AI models cross-check each other.
>
> It's like having two smart friends watch the video and compare notes. If they disagree, we dig deeper.
>
> Result: summaries you can actually trust.
>
> 3/ What you get:
> - Quick summary (30 seconds)
> - Deep contextual summary (10-15 min read — preserves the *reasoning*, not just bullet points)
> - Audio version for your commute
> - Refresher cards you can swipe through
>
> 4/ Free tier: 15 summaries per month. No credit card.
>
> Most competitors give you 1-3 per day and make you feel like a criminal for wanting more. We want you to actually try it before deciding.
>
> 5/ Try it → [App Store link]
>
> And if you've been following this build journey — thank you. Your poll answers, DM suggestions, and "me too" replies shaped this thing.
>
> Let me know what you think. Genuinely. 🙏

**During launch week (daily posts):**

> 24 hours since launch.
>
> [X] downloads. [X] summaries generated. And someone already summarized a 4-hour Joe Rogan episode.
>
> The future is efficient.

---

> My favorite thing so far: watching the "first summary" reactions.
>
> "Wait, it actually explains *why* the speaker said that?"
>
> That's the whole point. Context, not just content.

---

> First bug report is in.
>
> (It's a feature I forgot to ship, not a crash. I'll take it.)
>
> Day 3 of CatchUp being live. Building in public means fixing in public too.

#### LinkedIn (Personal — Launch)

> Today I'm launching CatchUp — a YouTube summarizer built on one idea: accuracy matters more than speed.
>
> Some context on why I built this:
>
> A few months ago I realized I had 400+ YouTube videos saved that I was never going to watch. Lectures, interviews, tutorials — all saved with good intentions, none consumed.
>
> I tried every summarizer tool I could find. The speed was impressive. The accuracy was not. I found tools that hallucinated statistics, missed key arguments, and reduced nuanced 45-minute discussions into 5 shallow bullet points.
>
> So I built what I wished existed:
>
> → Contextual summaries that preserve reasoning, not just conclusions
> → Multiple AI models cross-checking each other for accuracy
> → Audio summaries for commutes
> → 15 free summaries per month — because trust is earned, not purchased
>
> If you've ever felt guilty about your Watch Later backlog, I'd love for you to try it.
>
> [App Store link]
>
> And a genuine ask: if you try it, tell me what's good AND what's broken. I'm a solo founder building in public, and early feedback is everything.

#### Instagram (Personal — Launch)

**Reel:** Quick 30-60 second "I built an app" video. You talking to camera, casual, showing the app on your phone. Keep it authentic, not polished.

Script outline:
- "So I had 400 YouTube videos in my Watch Later..."
- "I tried every summarizer tool and they all got stuff wrong"
- "So I built one that actually checks its own work"
- "It's called CatchUp, it's on the App Store, link in bio"

**Carousel post:** 5-6 slides
1. "I just launched my first app" (hook)
2. The problem (Watch Later screenshot / guilt)
3. What I tried (competitor issues)
4. What CatchUp does differently (accuracy, contextual summaries)
5. Free tier details
6. "Link in bio — tell me what you think"

### 📱 App Accounts — Post-Launch

**The app accounts should feel like a smart, helpful friend — not a brand.**

#### Twitter/X (App — content engine)

**Summary showcases (2-3x per week — this is your bread and butter):**

> Just summarized: [Creator Name]'s new video on [topic]
>
> The 3 things you need to know:
>

>
> The longest video summarized? 4 hours 17 minutes.
>
> The shortest? 47 seconds. (Why did you need a summary of that?)

---

> Features nobody asked for but we built anyway:
>
> ☐ Dark mode (okay you did ask for this)
> ☐ [fun feature]
> ☐ [fun feature]
>
> Features everyone asked for that we're still building:
> ☐ [feature]
> ☐ [feature]

**Reactive engagement (daily practice):**

- Search "YouTube watch later" and engage with relatable tweets
- Reply to people sharing "must watch" video lists with a helpful (not pushy) mention
- Engage with productivity/learning accounts
- Quote-tweet viral YouTube videos with quick summary hooks

#### LinkedIn (App — company page)

Post 2-3x per week. More polished, professional value angle.

> We summarized this week's most-shared TED Talk on LinkedIn.
>
> Here are the 5 takeaways — in case you don't have 18 minutes right now:
>
> [summary highlights]
>
> Full contextual summary available in CatchUp.

> How professionals are using CatchUp:
>
> → A product manager summarizes competitor keynotes during lunch
> → A med student reviews 3-hour lectures in 15 minutes
> → A content creator researches 10 videos in the time it takes to watch 1
>
> What would you use it for?

---

## Reddit Strategy (Post-Launch, Month 2+)

**Golden rule:** Be helpful first. Sell never. Let people discover the product naturally.

**Target subreddits:** r/productivity, r/GetStudying, r/ADHD, r/Entrepreneur, r/podcasts, r/youtube, r/selfimprovement, r/parentinghacks

**Approach:**

1. **Weeks 1-4:** Just participate. Answer questions, share genuine advice about learning and productivity. Build karma and reputation. Zero mentions of your app.

2. **Month 2+:** When someone posts about "too many saved videos" or "how to learn from YouTube efficiently" — share your experience naturally. "I actually built an app for this because I had the same problem."

3. **Never post "check out my app" threads.** Reddit will destroy you. Instead, let it come up organically or share value-first content like "I summarized the top 20 recommended YouTube videos from this subreddit — here are the key insights."

---

## Content Ideas Bank

A running list of post ideas you can pull from anytime:

### Polls & Questions
- "What's the longest YouTube video in your Watch Later right now?"
- "Do you listen to YouTube videos or watch them? (Be honest)"
- "How many YouTube subscriptions do you have vs. how many do you actually watch?"
- "What's your YouTube guilty pleasure channel?"
- "If you could only watch 3 YouTube channels for the rest of your life, which ones?"
- "What time of day do you usually watch YouTube?"
- "Do you share YouTube videos with coworkers? How often do they actually watch them?"
- "What would you do with an extra 5 hours per week?"
- "Name a YouTube video that genuinely changed your life"
- "What's your 'I'll finish this later' record? (days since you saved a video)"

### Relatable Content
- Meme: "YouTube algorithm knowing I'll save it and never watch it"
- "The distance between 'saved to Watch Later' and 'actually watched' is approximately infinite"
- "My Watch Later playlist is basically a graveyard of good intentions"
- "When someone recommends a 2-hour YouTube video: 'I'll definitely check that out' (narrator: they did not)"

### Value Content
- "5 YouTube channels every [profession] should follow (and how to actually keep up with them)"
- "How to learn from YouTube without spending 40 hours a week watching"
- "The case for reading summaries AND watching videos (they serve different purposes)"
- "Why 2x speed isn't the answer to your YouTube backlog"

---

## Metrics to Track

| **Selling** | Almost never (let the product speak) | Soft (value-first, CTA secondary) |
| **Frequency** | 3-5x/week | 5-7x/week |

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **This week:** Start posting 2-3x on Twitter and LinkedIn (personal). Use the pre-launch polls and origin story posts above.
