## 🚀 TOP 10 OPPORTUNITIES (Prioritized by Impact)

### 🔥 CRITICAL (Must-Have for Launch)

1. **Multi-Model Validation** - GPT-4 + Claude cross-check = no hallucinations
2. **Generous Free Tier** - 15-20 summaries/month vs 1-3 standard = viral growth
3. **iOS-First Strategy** - Fragmented market (top app only 1.6K reviews)

### ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY (3-6 Month Roadmap)

4. **Confidence Scores** - Show AI certainty per section = trust
5. **Native Mobile Apps** - Not web wrapper = better UX
6. **Educational Features** - Flashcards/quizzes (Knowt has 5M students)
7. **Export Excellence** - PDF, Markdown, Anki cards

### 💎 STRATEGIC (6-12 Months)

8. **Team Collaboration** - B2B market untapped = $50-$500/mo
9. **Privacy/Offline Desktop** - Local processing = enterprise market
10. **Real-Time Summarization** - Live streams = premium feature

## 💰 RECOMMENDED PRICING STRATEGY

| Tier | Price | Features | Target |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| **Free** | $0 | 15 summaries/month, 60-min videos | Build trust & viral growth |
| **Growth** | $9/mo or $79/yr | Unlimited, all features | Regular users (sweet spot) |
| **Pro** | $19/mo or $169/yr | Multi-model, API, advanced | Power users |
| **Team** | $79/mo (5 users) | Collaboration, shared library | Small teams |
